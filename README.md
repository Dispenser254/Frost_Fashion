## UX

The website was created to be eye-catching and user-friendly. The user is given plenty of choices to choose from when they are shopping. The emphasis is on the user experience; the user can navigate the website easily to fulfill users' goals. The website is designed to be easy to use and easy to understand. Additionally, the website attracts customers to become a part of loyalty programs by giving them additional discounts on their purchases.
It also handles all personnel functionality moving from admin to manager to logistics to other personnel.
Business goals were to make the website as scalable as possible and reusable in the real world so that the store personnel could use it according to their position in the company.
